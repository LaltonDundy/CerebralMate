CerebralMate: "Literate Brainfuck" for people with huge brains 

***

* Have you ever spent the day writing Brainfuck code and thought to yourself "I read way too many books for this"?
* Have you ever thought that your deep knowledge of Basque grammar hasn't been quite applied in your code as much as you want it to be?
* Do you agree with this statement: "We live in a society" ?

If you had said yes to any of these questions, then this is the language for you. 

I present to you, CerebralMate, a literate BrainFuck. 

What makes CerebralMate literate? 

Well for other reasons than being written by a council of the most woke and informed intellectuals on the planet, CerebralMate let's you write pretty much anything you want.

I can hear you right now "Anything? Can we get compiler errors?" .

No, my dear boy. Compiler erros are medievel. Why have the computer tell us what to say, think, and write when we are clearly the most capable of knowing the difference between good and bad code.
Computers are dumb and need to step aside and let our magnificent huge brains do all of the work. Do computers have brains? I think not.

Quite more precisly, CerebralMate does not take words at face value. It only really needs two things: the length of your word, and to know whether or not the first letter pf the word is capitalized.

These combinations of parameters coorespond to all 8 of Brainfuck's operators. 

+ with first letter not capitalized

| CerebralMate  | BrainFuck     |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| length <  4   |       <       |
| length == 4   |       >       |
| length == 5   |       +       |
| length >  5   |       -       |

+ with first letter capitalized

| CerebralMate  | BrainFuck     |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| length <  4   |       .       |
| length == 4   |       ,       |
| length == 5   |       [       |
| length >  5   |       ]       |

due to this, programs that read different may be the same.

In CerebralMate these two programs are equivalent.
